## **Living in the U.S. Website**

### **Overview**

This is a basic website project designed to provide information about living in the U.S. It currently offers a search functionality for users to ask questions and receive relevant answers.

### **How it Works**

The website utilizes a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve its functionality:

* **HTML:** Defines the structure of the webpage, including the header, search section, and results section.
* **CSS:** Controls the visual presentation of the website (defined in a separate Styles.css file).
* **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity, handling user input and displaying search results.

### **Current Functionality**

Users can enter a question in the search bar and click the "search" button. However, the actual search logic and displaying results are not yet implemented.

### **Next Steps**

To make the search functionality work, you'll need to:

1. **Implement the search logic in `app.js`:**
   * Capture the user's search query from the input field.
   * Access and search relevant data from `dados.js`.
   * Display the search results in the "resultados-pesquisa" section.
2. **Complete the `Styles.css` file:** Define the visual style of the website.
3. **Consider adding more features:** Expand the website with additional content or functionalities.

**By following these steps, you can create a fully functional and informative website about living in the U.S.**
